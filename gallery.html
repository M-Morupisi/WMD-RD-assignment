        <p class="what"> cake - a celebration in every slice—a symphony of sweetness and texture that delights the senses. Imagine cutting through a soft, moist crumb that yields effortlessly to your fork, each layer infused with rich flavor—be it velvety chocolate, fragrant vanilla, or zesty lemon. A smooth, silky frosting wraps around it like a decadent hug, whether it’s a cloud of whipped cream, a luscious buttercream, or a glossy ganache. The aroma alone teases your taste buds, promising comfort and joy</p>

        <p class="what">cupcake- a little bundle of joy wrapped in a paper hug—petite, playful, and utterly irresistible. Beneath its perfectly domed top lies a tender, moist cake that bursts with flavor—rich chocolate, creamy vanilla, or maybe a hint of citrus or spice. Swirled high with luscious frosting—smooth buttercream, whipped cream, or velvety ganache—it’s a decadent crown that's as delightful to look at as it is to taste.</p>

Its sweet glaze glistens invitingly, catching the light and promising that first blissful bite. Whether it’s coated in sugar, drizzled with chocolate, filled with silky cream or fruity jam, every variation is a small miracle of indulgence. There's a slight crunch as your teeth break the surface, followed by a rush of flavor—sweet, rich, and utterly comforting</p>
